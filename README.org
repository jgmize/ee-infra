* Current status
- New AWS account active
  - Dedicated to EE infra, billed to EE
  - Admin privileges to be shared between EE, IT, and EY
- Premium support contract signed and active with Engine Yard
- moz.works domain registered via route53
- SSL certs requested for *.us-east.moz.works & *.eu-west.moz.works
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1195875
  - wildcard certs require opsec approval, but hopefully we can get that quickly
  - Need to terminate SSL at ELBs for performance and client support reasons
    - this will require multiple ELBs per cluster
    - Older clients such as ie8 and below on XP do not support SNI
- Tentatively scheduled to build 2 new clusters Thursday from 2-4 PM CDT
  - each cluster will consist of 2 autoscaling groups
    - 5 node fixed-size running both control and data planes
    - separate data-plane only autoscaling group
      - manually scaled to 0 instances under "normal" operations
      - separate group will be for load testing and DDoS mitigation purposes
  - will use kubernetes in one cluster (us-east), fleet in the other (eu-central)
    - this allows us to evaluate the tradeoffs of each scheduler based on actual deployments
  - neither cluster will use ceph
    - use HPV instead of PV instances
    - configure S3 buckets and RDS DBs
  - bastion host in each VPC for ssh access
  - jenkins master in us-east
    - artifacts + job state in EBS for failure recovery
